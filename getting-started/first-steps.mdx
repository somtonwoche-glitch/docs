# Your First Steps

1. **Set your level** — Tell Sage what you're studying
2. **Chat with Sage** — Ask any academic question
3. **Generate a Quiz** — Enter a topic, get instant questions
4. **Upload Notes** — Upload PDFs or photos, ask questions about them
5. **Create a Study Plan** — Enter exam dates, get a schedule

**Pro tip:** Be specific. "Explain the stages of mitosis for WAEC Biology" beats "Explain mitosis."
