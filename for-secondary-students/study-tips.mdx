# Study Tips for Nigerian Students

## Top Techniques
1. **Active Recall** — Test yourself instead of re-reading. Use StudyOps quizzes.
2. **Spaced Repetition** — Review topics at increasing intervals.
3. **Pomodoro** — Study 25 minutes, break 5 minutes.
4. **Teach It** — Explain concepts to a friend (or to Sage in Pidgin!)
5. **Past Questions** — The single best predictor of exam questions.

## Energy Management
- Study hard topics when you're most alert (usually morning)
- Review easier topics in the evening
- Don't study for more than 2 hours without a break
