# Pidgin Mode 🇳🇬

Not everyone vibes with formal English textbook language. Pidgin Mode makes Sage explain concepts in Nigerian Pidgin English — the way you'd explain things to a friend.

## How to Enable
Change your personality to **Pidgin** in Settings.

## Example
**Normal:** "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy."

**Pidgin:** "Photosynthesis na the way wey plant dey use sunlight take make food. The plant go take the light, mix am with water and CO2, come produce glucose wey be the food, plus oxygen wey we dey breathe."

Technical terms stay in English, but everything else flows in Pidgin naturally.
