# Low Data Mode

StudyOps automatically detects your network speed and adapts:

| Network | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **4G/WiFi** | Full responses, images, voice features |
| **3G** | Shorter responses, compressed content |
| **2G** | Minimal responses, text only, no images |
| **Offline** | Access cached content only |

## How It Works
- AI responses are automatically shortened on slow connections
- Images are compressed or skipped
- Voice features are disabled on 2G
- Chat history is trimmed to save storage

You don't need to toggle anything — it happens automatically.
