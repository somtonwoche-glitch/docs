# Nigerian Curriculum Alignment

StudyOps is built with the Nigerian education system in mind. Sage understands:

- **WAEC/NECO** syllabi for SS1-SS3
- **JAMB/UTME** subject combinations and past question patterns
- **Nigerian university** course structures (100-500 level)
- **Professional exams** — ICAN, ANAN, NIM and more

When you ask a question, Sage automatically adds Nigerian exam context, relevant past question tips, and marking scheme awareness.
