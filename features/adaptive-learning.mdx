# Adaptive Learning

StudyOps learns how you study and adapts accordingly.

## How It Adapts
- **Difficulty level** — Adjusts explanations based on your understanding
- **Response length** — Shorter on slow connections, detailed on fast ones
- **Subject focus** — Remembers your courses and tailors examples
- **Exam alignment** — Focuses on what's likely to come up in your exams
