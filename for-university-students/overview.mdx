# StudyOps for University Students

Whether you're in 100 level or writing your final year project, StudyOps adapts to your level and course.

## Tell Sage Your Details
Start by saying something like: "I'm a 300-level Mechanical Engineering student at UNIBEN"

Sage will then tailor all responses to your level, using relevant examples and exam patterns from your field.
